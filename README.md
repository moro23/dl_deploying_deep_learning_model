## Deploying a Deep Learning Model

### Introduction
Practical lab session for week 1 of Machine Learning Engineering for Production Course. 
This involve deploying an already trained Deep learning model using FastApI due to it 
ease of use and provides a nice REST API framework. We are going to use two approaches which 
involves: Python Virtual Environment and/or using Docker.

## Method 1
### Environment Setup Using Python Virtual Env
- Installing Virtual Env Tool
    - pip install pipenv 
- Installing dependencies via Pipenv
    - pipevn install cvlib opencv-python-headless pillow tensorflow unicorn python-multipart fastapi nest-asyncio jupyterlab
- Activing Virtual Environment
    - pipenv shell
- Starting notebook
    - jupyter lab

## Method 2
### Docker Setup
